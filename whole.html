        They <font color="#ff343f">s</font>ay there is a war<br>
        Between the man and the woman (ah, ah)<br>
        I've never felt like this before<br>
        My heart knew that I couldn't (ah)<br>
        <br>
        And then you take me in<br>
        And everything in me begins to feel like I belong<br>
        Like everybody needs a home<br>
        And when I take your hand<br>
        Like the world has never held a man<br>
        I know I cannot heal the hurt<br>
        But I will hold you here forever<br>
        If I can, if I can<br>
        <br>
        And then I learned the truth<br>
        How ev<font color="#ff343f">e</font>rything good in life seems to lead back to you<br>
        And every single time I run into your arms<br>
        I feel like I exist for love<br>
        Like I exist for love<br>
        Only for love<br>
        <br>
        I can't imagine how it is<br>
        To be forbidden from loving (ah, ah)<br>
        'Cause when you walked into my life<br>
        I could feel my life begin<br>
        <br>
        Like I was torn apart the minute I was only born<br>
        And you're the other half<br>
        The only thing that makes me w<font color="#ff343f">h</font>ole<br>
        I know it sounds like a lot<br>
        But you really need to know<br>
        We are leaning out for love<br>
        And we will lean for love forever, I know<br>
        I love you so<br>
        <br>
        And then I learned the truth<br>
        How everything good in life seems to lead back to you<br>
        And every single time I run into your arms<br>
        I feel like I exi<font color="#ff343f">s</font>t for love<br>
        Only for love<br>
        And when you say my name<br>
        Like white horses on the waves<br>
        I think it feels the same<br>
        As an oce<font color="#ff343f">a</font>n in my veins<br>
        And you'll be diving in<br>
        Like nothing is out of place<br>
        And we exist for love<br>
        Only for love<br>
        <br>
        And I love you, I love you, I love you<br>
        And I love you, I love you, I love you<br>
    </p>
    <br><br><br>

        Con cari√±o,
