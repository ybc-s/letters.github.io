    <p class="lyrics">
        There's a place I wanna take you<br>
        But I'm not quite there myself yet<br>
        (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)<br>
        I'm getting better but there's still days<br>
        Where I wish that I was someone else<br>
        But I know
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        There is a home, somewhere<br>
        Beyond my bones<br>
        And I'm just too terrified<br>
        To dive inside
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        Soul like a cemetery<br>
        Hard to ignore, we're sick to the core<br>
        A world's been buried<br>
        Where love is the law, a youtopia
    </p>

        (Scream)

    <p class="lyrics">
        Golden raspberry<br>
        For the performance in your head<br>
        (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)<br>
        Stop pushing daisies<br>
        No one wants flowers when they're dead
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        Soul like a cemetery<br>

    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        (There is a home) There is a home, ah-ah-ah<br>
        (Beyond our bones) Beyond our bones<br>
        So connect to the Divine<br>
        It's okay to cry, yeah

        What was it like?<br>
        It's like I walked into a dream<br>
        And stepped out of the coma
