    <p class="lyrics">
        Well, I know what you want from me<br>
        You want someone to be<br>
        Your reflection, your bitter deception<br>
        Setting you free<br>
        So you take what you want and leave<br>
        <br>
        Who made you like this?<br>
        Who encrypted your dark gospel in body language?<br>
        Synapses snap back in blissful anguish<br>
        Tell me you met me in past lives, past life<br>
        Past what might be eating me from the inside, darling<br>
        Half algorithm, half deity<br>
        Glitches in the code or gaps in a strange dream<br>
        Tell me you guessed my future and it mapped onto your fantasy<br>
        Turn me into your mannequin and I'll turn you into my puppet queen<br>
        <br>
        Won't you come and dance in the dark with me?<br>
        Show me what you are, I am desperate to know<br>
        Nobody better than the perfect enemy<br>
        Digital demons make the night feel heavenly<br>
        <br>
        Make it real<br>
        'Cause anything's better than the way I feel right now<br>
        I can offer you a blacklit paradise<br>
        Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky<br>
        <br>
        Lipstick, chemtrails, red flags, pink nails<br>
        With one eye on the door, other eye on a rail<br>
        Other, other eye following a scarlet trail<br>
        And the last few drops from the Holy Grail, now<br>
        Rose gold chains, ripped lace, cut glass<br>
        Blood stains on the collar, please, just don't ask<br>
        Be the first to the feast, let's choke on the past<br>
        And take to the broken skies at last<br>
        <br>
        Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky<br>
        Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky<br>
        Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky<br>
        Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky<br>
        <br>
        Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky<br>
        Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky<br>
        Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky<br>
        Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky<br>
        You're gonna watch me ascend<br>
        <br>
        And I know what you want from me<br>
        You want the same as me<br>
        My redemption, eternal ascension<br>
        Setting me free<br>
        So I'll take what I want then leave<br>
        <br>
        You make me wish I could disappear, oh<br>
        You make me wish I could disappearWell, I know what you want from me <br>
