    <p class="lyrics">
        Eyes like a car crash<br>
        I know I shouldn't look, but I can't turn away<br>
        Body like a whiplash<br>
        Salt my wounds, but I can't heal the way I feel about you<br>
        I watch you like a hawk<br>
        I watch you like I'm gonna tear you limb from limb<br>
        Will the hunger ever stop?<br>
        Can we simply starve this sin?<br>
        <br>
        That little kiss you stole, it held my heart and soul<br>
        And like a deer in the headlights, I meet my fate<br>
        Don't try to fight the storm, you'll tumble overboard<br>
        Tides will bring me back to you<br>
        <br>
        And on my deathbed, all I'll see is you<br>
        The life may leave my lungs, but my heart will stay with you<br>
        <br>
        That little kiss you stole, it held my heart and soul<br>
        And like a ghost in the silence, I disappear<br>
        Don't try to fight the storm, you'll tumble overboard<br>
        Tides will bring me back to you<br>
        <br>
        The waves will pull us under<br>
        Tides will bring me back to you<br>
        The waves will pull us under<br>
        Tides will bring me back to you<br>
        The waves will pull us under<br>
        Tides will bring me back to you<br>
        Tides will bring me back to you<br>
        <br>
        That little kiss you stole, it held my heart and soul<br>
        And like a ghost in the silence, I disappear<br>
        Don't try to fight the storm, you'll tumble overboard<br>
        Tides will bring me back to you<br>
        That little kiss you stole, it held my heart and soul<br>
        And like a deer in the headlights, I meet my fate<br>
        Don't try to fight the storm, you'll tumble overboard<br>
        Tides will bring me back to you<br>
