            Love, was just a passing phase<br>
            A fever that ran away, 'til they could find us where we lay<br>
            Blood, they smell it from miles away<br>
            Try to look past and see, and just get used to the taste<br>
            <br>
            But don't leave me here<br>
            Don't leave me here<br>
            <br>
            And don't walk away, and let me die<br>
            Oh, in this house of wolves<br>
            And pray for my soul, now that I go<br>
            Into this house of wolves<br>
            <br>
            Don't believe what you read, or sometimes what you see<br>
            But most of it is true, too true<br>
            And are you happy this way? And scalpels bring back this face<br>
            Tell the judge that I'm innocent, tell the jury I'm no one at all<br>
            <br>
            But don't leave me here<br>
            Don't leave me here<br>
            <br>
            Don't walk away, and let me die<br>
            Oh, in this house of wolves<br>
            And pray for my soul, now that I go<br>
            Into this house of wolves<br>
            <br>
            Hey, do you want it?<br>
            <br>
            Ah, the bleeding<br>
            Don't stop the bleeding in your heart<br>
            The bleeding, don't stop that bleeding in your<br>
            Ah, the bleeding<br>
            Don't stop the bleeding in your heart<br>
            The bleeding, don't stop<br>
            <br>
            But don't leave me here<br>
            Don't leave me here<br>
            <br>
            Don't walk away, let me die<br>
            Oh, in this house of wolves<br>
            And pray for my soul, now that I go<br>
            Into this house of wolves<br>
            Don't walk away, and let me die<br>
            Oh, in this house of wolves<br>
            And pray for my soul, now that I go<br>
            Into this house of wolves<br>
            <br>
            You cannot stop the bleeding, baby<br>
            You cannot stop the bleeding, baby<br>
            She won't stop the bleeding, baby<br>
            She won't stop<br>
            Don't walk away, and let me die<br>
            Oh, in this house of wolves, and pray<br>
