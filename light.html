    <p class="lyrics">
        Drowning in the Blue Nile<br>
        He sent me 'Downtown Lights'<br>
        I hadn't heard it in a while<br>
        My boredom's bone deep<br>
        This cage was once just fine<br>
        Am I allowed to cry?<br>
        I dream of cracking locks<br>
        Throwing my life to the wolves<br>
        Or the ocean rocks<br>
        Crashing into him tonight<br>
        He's a paradox<br>
        I'm seeing visions, am I bad?<br>
        Or mad? Or wise?
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        What if he's written 'mine' on my upper thigh<br>
        Only in my mind?<br>
        One slip and falling back into the hedge maze<br>
        Oh what a way to die<br>
        I keep recalling things we never did<br>
        Messy top lip kiss<br>
        How I long for our trysts<br>
        Without ever touching his skin<br>
        How can I be guilty as sin?
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        I keep these longings locked<br>
        In lowercase inside a vault<br>
        Someone told me<br>
        There's no such thing as bad thoughts<br>
        Only your actions talk<br>
        These fatal fantasies<br>
        Giving way to labored breath<br>
        Taking all of me<br>
        We've already done it in my head<br>
        If it's make believe<br>
        Why does it feel like a vow<br>
        We'll both uphold somehow?
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        What if he's written 'mine' on my upper thigh<br>
        Only in my mind?<br>
        One slip and falling back into the hedge maze<br>
        Oh what a way to die<br>
        My bedsheets are ablaze<br>
        I've screamed his name<br>
        Building up like waves<br>
        Crashing over my grave<br>
        Without ever touching his skin<br>
        How can I be guilty as sin?
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        What if I roll the stone away?<br>
        They're gonna crucify me anyway<br>
        What if the way you hold me<br>
        Is actually what's holy?<br>
        If long suffering propriety<br>
        Is what they want from me<br>
        They don't know how you've haunted me<br>
        So stunningly<br>
        I choose you and me<br>
        ... Religiously
    </p>
