    <p class="lyrics">
        You are the light I've been searchin' for forever
        Feels like, man, I've really never felt the rain
        Buried in the desert, didn't think I'd push through the dirt
        You just cleansed me like a waterfall, you came











    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        I'm screamin' like a kettle on a stove<br>
        You cranked the heat up, I was cold, my past grew mold around my heart<br>
        And all my anger, sadness, regret, disappeared<br>
        It's madness I'm not used to all this water, love, it's true

    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        But you make me want to<br>
        Plan out my last days on earth, eating you<br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh, the tips of your teeth<br>
        Fit perfect in me, you're the shower of light<br>
        I devour, any day of the week<br>
        Baby, cleanse me
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        I was surprised to see Heaven in your eyes<br>
        I never once was treated right, you're what I'm missin' in my life<br>
        As bright as the sun, give me your Vitamin D, let's run into<br>
        Another dimension, you make me feel like I'm on drugs
    </p>
