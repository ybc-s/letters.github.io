        Just run it back, give me five whole minutes<br>
        I am thick tar on the inside burning<br>
        I've got a ghost in the hallway grinning<br>
        And a heavy head that won't stop turning<br>
        If my fate is a bad collision<br>
        And if my mind is an open highway<br>
        Give me the twilight two-way vision<br>
        Give me one last ride on a sunset sky lane<br>
        <br>
        Call me when you get the chance<br>
        I can feel the walls around me closing in<br>
        <br>
        Just running forward, a life like wires<br>
        As I see the past on an empty ceiling<br>
        I play along with the life signs anyway<br>
        But hope to God you don't know this feeling<br>
        Yet in reverse, you are all my symmetry<br>
        A parallel I would lay my life on<br>
        So if your wings won't find you Heaven<br>
        I will bring it down like an ancient bygone<br>
        <br>
        Call me when you have the time<br>
        I just need to leave this part of me behind<br>
        <br>
        Do you remember me<br>
        When the rain gathers?<br>
        And do you still believe<br>
        That nothing else matters?<br>
        <br>
        For me<br>
        It's still the autumn leaves<br>
        These ancient canopies<br>
        That we used to lay beneath<br>
        <br>
        No, by now<br>
        The night belongs to you<br>
        This bough has broken through<br>
        I must be someone new<br>
        <br>
        No, for me<br>
        (Run it back, give me five whole minutes)<br>
        (I am thick tar on the inside burning) it's still the autumn leaves<br>
        (I've got a ghost in the hallway grinning)<br>
        (And a heavy head that won't stop turning) these ancient canopies<br>
        (If my fate is a bad collision)<br>
        (And if my mind is an open highway) we used to lay beneath<br>
        (Give me the twilight two-way vision)<br>
        <br>
        now, by now<br>
        (Just running forward, alive like wires)<br>
        (As I see the past on an empty ceiling) the night belongs to you<br>
        (I play along with the life signs anyway)<br>
        (But hope to God you don't know this feeling) this bough has broken through<br>
        (Yet in reverse, you are all my symmetry)<br>
        (A parallel I would lay my life on) I must be someone new<br>
        (So if your wings won't find you Heaven)<br>
        (I will bring it down like an ancient bygone)<br>
        <br>
        The whites of your eyes<br>
        Turn black in the low light<br>
        In turning divine<br>
        And we tangle endlessly<br>
        Like lovers entwined<br>
        I know for the last time<br>
        You will not be mine<br>
        So give me the night, the night, the night<br>
