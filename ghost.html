        Go<br>
        <br>
        To un-explain the unforgivable<br>
        Drain all the blood and give the kids a show<br>
        By streetlight this dark night<br>
        A s√©ance down below<br>
        There're things that I have done<br>
        You never should ever know<br>
        <br>
        And without you is how I disappear<br>
        And live my life alone forever now<br>
        And without you is how I disappear<br>
        And live my life alone forever now<br>
        <br>
        Who walks among the famous living dead<br>
        Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed<br>
        And if you could talk to me<br>
        Tell me if it's so<br>
        That all the good girls go to heaven<br>
        Well, heaven knows<br>
        <br>
        That without you is how I disappear<br>
        And live my life alone forever now<br>
        And without you is how I disappear<br>
        And live my life alone forever now<br>
        <br>
        Can you hear me cry out to you?<br>
        Words I thought I'd choke on figure out<br>
        I'm really not so with you anymore<br>
        I'm just a ghost<br>
        So I can't hurt you anymore<br>
        So I can't hurt you anymore<br>
        <br>
        And now, you wanna see how far down I can sink?<br>
        Let me go, fuck<br>
        So, you can, well now so, you can<br>
        I'm so far away from you<br>
        Well now so, you can<br>
        <br>
        And without you is how I disappear<br>
        And without you is how I disappear<br>
        Whoa whoa (and without you is how I disappear)<br>
        Whoa whoa (and without you, is how, is how, is how)<br>
        Forever, forever now<br>
