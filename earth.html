    <p class="lyrics">
        You don't know a thing about this life<br>
        And we are up for everything it takes<br>
        To prove we're not the same as them<br>
        And we will wear our masks<br>
        Again out after dark<br>
        'Cause we are up for everything it takes<br>
        <br>
        And we are not the same<br>
        'Cause we are not afraid<br>
        And we are not ashamed<br>
        <br>
        And if you save my life<br>
        I'll be the one who drives you home tonight<br>
        And if they ever let you down<br>
        I'll be the one who drives you home tonight<br>
        <br>
        Never want to walk this kind of life<br>
        Quietly I'll sleep behind the wheel<br>
        And passing every face you see<br>
        But first I'll<br>
        Take in every piece as you walk by<br>
        Proving that we follow my mistakes<br>
        <br>
        And we are not the same<br>
        'Cause we are not the same<br>
        And we are all to blame<br>
        <br>
        And if you save my life<br>
        I'll be the one who drives you home tonight<br>
        And if they ever let you down<br>
        I'll be the one who drives you home tonight<br>
        You home tonight<br>
        <br>
        It's driving you down<br>
        It's driving you down<br>
        It's driving you down<br>
        It's driving you down<br>
        It's driving you down<br>
        'Cause it's driving you down<br>
        And it's driving you<br>
        Driving you down<br>
        <br>
        And you don't know a thing about this life<br>
        And you don't know a thing about this life<br>
        And you don't know a thing about this life<br>
        'Cause you don't know a thing about me<br>
        You don't know a thing<br>
        <br>
        And if you save my life<br>
        I'll be the one who drives you home tonight<br>
        And if they ever let you down<br>
        I'll be the one who drives you home tonight<br>
        You home tonight<br>
        Drives you home tonight<br>
        <br>
        'Cause it's driving you down<br>
        'Cause it's driving you down<br>
        'Cause it's driving you down<br>
        'Cause it's driving you<br>
        Driving you<br>
        Driving you down<br>
