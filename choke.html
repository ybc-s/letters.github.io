    <p class="lyrics">
        For the time being<br>
        I will still avoid my own questions<br>
        And we both bury that history deep<br>
        But you know I can hold my breath forever<br>
        <br>
        For the time being<br>
        You are still a perfect reminder of what<br>
        All of these scars on my arms are for<br>
        If I can hold myself together<br>
        <br>
        And I choke myself on sacred vapour<br>
        Waiting on some holy favour<br>
        Basking in the solace of regret<br>
        And it seems my hell is your high water<br>
        Wash me clean again before I pull myself beneath the waves<br>
        <br>
        When the mouth of infinity<br>
        Buries its teeth in me<br>
        I'll smile through the agony for you<br>
        And I know you still bear the weight of your own existence<br>
        And you'll never bear the weight of two<br>
        <br>
        And I choke myself on sacred vapour<br>
        Waiting on some holy favour<br>
        Basking in the solace of regret<br>
        And it seems my hell is your high water<br>
        Wash me clean again before I pull myself beneath the waves<br>
        <br>
        For the time being<br>
        I will admit my defeat again<br>
        I will accept that I can't pretend<br>
        We will ever be together<br>
        <br>
        I can't hold myself together<br>
