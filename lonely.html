        I don't wanna...

        Rat race, place to place, adding weight<br>
        Tendencies on repeat, innit<br>
        Benefit from a shoe with no lace<br>
        Take the seat with the crease in it<br>
        I don't mind if it's lonely<br>
        I don't mind if it's fair<br>
        I don't care, you control me<br>
        Leading me anywhere<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna backslide to where I've started from<br>
        There's no chance I will shake this again<br>
        'Cause I feel the pull, water's over my head<br>
        Strength enough for one more time<br>
        Reach my hand above the tide<br>
        I'll take anything you have if you could throw me a line<br>
        I should've loved you better<br>
        Do you think that now's the time you should let go?<br>
        It's over my head<br>
        <br>
        Bad place on a hundred dollar bass<br>
        Kind of wishing that I never did Saturday<br>
        Is that a stain? You should change<br>
        Are you doing good? Did you solve all of your problems?<br>
        Thanks for asking, in a way, but<br>
        Accidentally uncovered a new one yesterday<br>
        What happened to what I brushed under the rug?<br>
        I used to be the champion of a world you can't see<br>
        Now I'm drowning in logistics<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna backslide to where I've started from<br>
        There's no chance I will shake this again<br>
        'Cause I feel the pull, water's over my head<br>
        Strength enough for one more time<br>
        Reach my hand above the tide<br>
        I'll take anything you have if you could throw me a line<br>
        I should've loved you better<br>
        Do you think that now's the time you should let go?<br>
        <br>
        it's over my head<br>
        (I don't mind if it's fair) you should let go<br>
        (I don't care you control me) it's over my head<br>
        (Leading me anywhere)<br>
        <br>
        I'll take anything you have if you could throw me a line<br>
        I should've loved you better<br>
        Do you think that now's the time you should let go?<br>
        It's over my head<br>
        You should let go<br>
        It's over my head<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna backslide<br>
