            Something you say or something you do <br>
            A taste of the divine

            Oh, and my love <br>
            Did I mistake you for a si<font color="#ff343f">g</font>n from God? <br>
            Or are you really here to cut me off? <br>
            Or maybe just to turn me on <br>
            'Cause these days <br>
            I would be lying if I told you that <br>
            I didn't wish that I could be your man <br>
            Or maybe make a good girl bad
