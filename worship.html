    <p class="lyrics">
        We were crazy to think<br>
        Crazy to think that this could work<br>
        Remember how I said I'd die for you?<br>
        <br>
        We were stupid to jump<br>
        In the ocean separating us<br>
        Remember how I'd fly to you?<br>
        <br>
        And I can't talk to you when you're like this<br>
        Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town<br>
        I'm New York City<br>
        I still do it for you, babe<br>
        They all warned us about times like this<br>
        They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by blind faith<br>
        Blind faith<br>
        <br>
        But we might just get away with it<br>
        Religion's in your lips<br>
        Even if it's a false god<br>
        We'd still worship<br>
        We might just get away with it<br>
        The altar is my hips<br>
        Even if it's a false god<br>
        We'd still worship this love<br>
        We'd still worship this love<br>
        We'd still worship this love<br>
        <br>
        I know heaven's a thing<br>
        I go there when you touch me<br>
        Honey hell is when I fight with you<br>
        <br>
        But we can patch it up good<br>
        Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness<br>
        Got the wine for you<br>
        <br>
        And you can't talk to me when I'm like this<br>
        Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you<br>
        You're the West Village<br>
        You still do it for me, babe<br>
        They all warned us about times like this<br>
        They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by blind faith<br>
        Blind faith<br>
        <br>
        But we might just get away with it<br>
        Religion's in your lips<br>
        Even if it's a false god<br>
        We'd still worship<br>
        We might just get away with it<br>
        The altar is my hips<br>
        Even if it's a false god<br>
        We'd still worship this love<br>
        We'd still worship this love<br>
        We'd still worship this love, ah<br>
        <br>
        Still worship this love<br>
        Even if it's a false god<br>
        Even if it's a false god<br>
        Still worship this love<br>
