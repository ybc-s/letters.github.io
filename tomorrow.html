    <p class="lyrics">
        Without a sound I took her down<br>
        And dressed in red and blue I squeezed<br>
        Imaginary wedding gown<br>
        That you can't wear in front of me<br>
        <br>
        A kiss goodbye<br>
        Your twisted shell<br>
        As rice grains and roses fall at your feet<br>
        Let's say goodbye, the hundredth time<br>
        And then tomorrow we'll do it again<br>
        <br>
        Tomorrow we'll do it again<br>
        <br>
        I dragged her down I put her out<br>
        And back there I left her where no one could see<br>
        And lifeless cold into this well<br>
        I stared as this moment was held for me<br>
        <br>
        A kiss goodbye<br>
        Your twisted shell<br>
        As rice grains and roses fall at your feet<br>
        Let's say goodbye, the hundredth time<br>
        And then tomorrow we'll do it again<br>
        <br>
        I never thought it'd be this way<br>
        Just me and you, we're here alone<br>
        And if you stay, all I'm asking for is<br>
        A thousand bodies piled up<br>
        I never thought would be enough<br>
        To show you just what I've been thinking<br>
        <br>
        And I'll keep on making more<br>
        Just to prove that I adore<br>
        Every inch of sanity<br>
        All I'm asking for is<br>
        All I'm asking for is<br>
        <br>
        Come on!<br>
        <br>
        These hands stained red<br>
        From the times that I've killed you and then<br>
        We can wash down this engagement ring<br>
        With poison and kerosene<br>
        We'll laugh as we die<br>
        And we'll celebrate the end of things<br>
        With cheap champagne<br>
        <br>
        Without, without a sound<br>
        Without, without a sound<br>
        And I wish you away<br>
        Without a sound<br>
        And I wish you away<br>
        Without a sound<br>
        Without a sound<br>
        And I wish you away<br>
        Without a sound<br>
        Without a sound<br>
        And I wish you away<br>
        Without a sound<br>
        Without a sound<br>
        And I wish you away<br>
