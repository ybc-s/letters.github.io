    <p class="lyrics">
        She bargains with the world<br>
        So everything she wants will come to her<br>
        With no greed inside her mind<br>
        She knows what she deserves<br>
        <br>
        We fell from sky with grace<br>
        And landed in her soft and warm embrace<br>
        She gave her love, her gift of life<br>
        So we could live with her<br>
        <br>
        That is why we live like heathens<br>
        Stealing from the trees of Eden<br>
        Living in the arms of freedom<br>
        And everything we touch is evil<br>
        That is why we live like heathens<br>
        <br>
        The stone, the dirt, the dust<br>
        The unforgiving promise made to us<br>
        Unworthy of your light, your god, your touch<br>
        We're guided by the lust<br>
        <br>
        We cry the fallen names<br>
        We cry for those who burn beneath the flame<br>
        We stand besides the good and brave<br>
        The broken and enslaved<br>
        <br>
        That is why we live like heathens<br>
        Stealing from the trees of Eden<br>
        Living in the arms of freedom<br>
        And everything we touch is evil<br>
        That is why we live like heathens<br>
        <br>
        Everything you touch will be hers<br>
        A mother with no heart will give love<br>
        <br>
        Her love is yours, but only if you give your heart to her<br>
        <br>
        That is why we live like heathens<br>
        Stealing from the trees of Eden<br>
        Living in the arms of freedom<br>
        And everything we touch is evil<br>
        That is why we live like heathens<br>
        <br>
        That is why we live like heathens<br>
        That is why we live like heathens<br>
