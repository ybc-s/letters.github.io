    <p class="lyrics">
        I dream in phosphorescence<br>
        Bleed through spaces<br>
        See you drifting past the fog<br>
        But no one told you where to go<br>
        <br>
        We dive through crystal waters, perfect oceans<br>
        But no one told me not to breathe<br>
        And now the weightlessness recedes<br>
        <br>
        My, my, those eyes like fire<br>
        I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre<br>
        Come now, bite through these wires<br>
        I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired<br>
        Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher<br>
        Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire<br>
        <br>
        I will travel far beyond the path of reason<br>
        Take me back to Eden, take me back to Eden<br>
        Take me back to Eden<br>
        <br>
        Well yeah, I spit blood when I wake up<br>
        Sink porcelain stained, choking up brain matter and makeup<br>
        Just two days since the mainframe went down and I'm still messed up<br>
        Room feels like a meat freezer, I dangle in it like cold cuts<br>
        Missed calls, answered phones from people I just don't trust<br>
        Mirror talk, fake love<br>
        But I'll take a pound of your flesh<br>
        Before you take a piece of my paystub<br>
        White roses, black doves, Godmother, rise up<br>
        I need you to see me for what I have become<br>
        <br>
        My, my, those eyes like fire<br>
        I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre<br>
        Come now, bite through these wires<br>
        I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired<br>
        Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher<br>
        Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire<br>
        <br>
        I guess it goes to show, does it not?<br>
        That we've no idea what we've got until we lose it<br>
        And no amount of love will keep it around<br>
        If we don't choose it<br>
        And I don't know what's got its teeth in me<br>
        But I'm about to bite back in anger<br>
        No amount of self-sought fury<br>
        Will bring back the glory of innocence<br>
        <br>
        My, my, those eyes like fire<br>
        I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre<br>
        Come now, bite through these wires<br>
        I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired<br>
        Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher<br>
        Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire<br>
        <br>
        I have traveled far beyond the path of reason<br>
        Take me back to Eden<br>
        Take me back to Eden <br>
    </p>

        Con cari√±o,
