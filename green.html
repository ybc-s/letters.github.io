        A year from now, we won't be pretty<br>
        A year from now, we won't be young<br>
        But we will live among the giants<br>
        Before the giants learn to run<br>
        <br>
        Now we are the blessed, now we are the strong<br>
        Take my hand, and let me know that it feels good<br>
        To feel at home<br>
        <br>
        We would sail across the ocean<br>
        If cloudy skies should take our friends<br>
        And we will learn from the giants<br>
        Before the giants learn from them<br>
        <br>
        Now we are the blessed, now we are the strong<br>
        Take my hand, and let me know that it feels good<br>
        To feel at home<br>
        <br>
        What can I say, without a say?<br>
        We've got a way to go, and what can I do<br>
        To get back to you, and help us to find a home<br>
        To search the green and town<br>
        <br>
        A year from now, we won't be lovers<br>
        We'll just be suits and ties and shoes<br>
        And we will grow without our parents<br>
        'Cause soon we will be giants too<br>
        <br>
        Now we are the blessed, now we are the strong<br>
        Take my hand, and let me know that it feels good<br>
        To feel at home<br>
        <br>
        What can I say, without a say?<br>
        We've got a way to go, and what can I do<br>
        To get back to you, and help us to find a home<br>
        To search the green and town<br>
        <br>
        I will search the green, and I will search the town<br>
        But I will never find no one like you<br>
        <br>
        I will search the green, and I will search the town<br>
        But I will never find no one like you<br>
        <br>
        I will search the green, and I will search the town<br>
        But I will never find no one like you<br>
        <br>
        I will search the green, and I will search the town<br>
        But I will never find no one like you<br>
        <br>
        I will search the green, and I will search the town<br>
        But I will never find no one like you<br>
        <br>
        I will search the green, and I will search the town<br>
        But I will never find no one like you<br>
        <br>
        I will search the green, and I will search the town<br>
        But I will never find no one like you<br>
