    <p class="lyrics">
        I was given a heart before I was given a mind<br>
        A thirst for pleasure and war, a hunger we keep inside<br>
        We fell from sky with grace, and life gave us a sweeter taste<br>
        You can drink, you can feast<br>
        There's beauty in your beast<br>
        <br>
        The flesh in the fruit and the blood in the wine<br>
        <br>
        Come on, and feel alive, lover<br>
        Come on, and feel the love like a sinner<br>
        Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say<br>
        I won't feel ashamed, mother<br>
        Can you break the chains, off her?<br>
        Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover<br>
        <br>
        I was given a name before I was given blood<br>
        Like you were given your faith, before there was made a God<br>
        Young rivers in your hands and glass burning in promised lands<br>
        You can drink, you can feast<br>
        There's beauty in your beast<br>
        <br>
        The flesh in the fruit and the blood in the wine<br>
        <br>
        Come on, and feel alive, lover<br>
        Come on, and feel the love like a sinner<br>
        Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say<br>
        I won't feel ashamed, mother<br>
        Can you break the chains, off her?<br>
        Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover<br>
        <br>
        Come on, and feel alive<br>
        Come on, feel the love<br>
        Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say (louder)<br>
        I won't feel ashamed, mother<br>
        Can you break the chains, off her?<br>
        Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover<br>
        <br>
        Come on, and feel alive, lover<br>
        Come on and feel the love, like a sinner<br>
        Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say<br>
        I won't feel ashamed, mother<br>
        Can you break the chains, off her?<br>
        Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover <br>
