        Slow down on Monday<br>
        Not a sound on Wednesday (yeah)<br>
        Might get loud (ayy) on Friday<br>
        But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday<br>
        We paint the town<br>
        <br>
        Lose my sense a time or two<br>
        Weeks feel like days<br>
        Medicate in the afternoon<br>
        And I just want to know<br>
        Have you lost your footing, too?<br>
        I just pray that I'm not losing you<br>
        <br>
        Catch me floating circles in my fishbowl<br>
        Keep things fresh<br>
        She said that I should change my clothes<br>
        I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        Slow down on Monday<br>
        Not a sound on Wednesday (yeah)<br>
        Might get loud (ayy) on Friday<br>
        But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday<br>
        We paint the town<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, you're good<br>
        These are my dancing shoes<br>
        We paint the town<br>
        Ooh, you're good<br>
        Thought I would dance with you<br>
        Might get loud (ayy) on Friday<br>
        But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday<br>
        We paint the town<br>
        <br>
        Life moves slow on the ocean floor (feeling great)<br>
        I can't feel the waves anymore<br>
        Did the tide forget to move?<br>
        I just pray that I'm not losing you<br>
        <br>
        Catch me floating circles in my fishbowl<br>
        Keep things fresh<br>
        She said that I should change my clothes<br>
        I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, yeah<br>
        <br>
        Working on music?<br>
        Yeah<br>
        I'll just to go to bed, I'm tired<br>
        I wanna watch "Friends" with you<br>
        Oh, if you feel like you have time to do a song or you're inspired<br>
        You should just go for it<br>
        <br>
        Not a sound on Wednesday<br>
        Might get loud (ayy) on Friday<br>
        But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday<br>
        We paint the town<br>
        <br>
        We paint, paint<br>
        Might get loud on Friday<br>
        But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday<br>
