    <p class="lyrics">
        Hear the sound<br>
        The angels come screaming<br>
        Down your voice<br>
        I hear you've been bleeding<br>
        <br>
        Make your choice<br>
        They say you've been pleading<br>
        Someone save us<br>
        <br>
        Heaven help us now<br>
        Come crashing down<br>
        We'll hear the sound<br>
        As you're falling down<br>
        <br>
        I'm at this old hotel<br>
        But can't tell if I've been breathing or sleeping<br>
        Or screaming or waiting for the man to call<br>
        And maybe all of the above<br>
        'Cause mostly I've been sprawled on these cathedral steps<br>
        While spitting out the blood and screaming<br>
        Someone save us<br>
        <br>
        Heaven help us now<br>
        Come crashing down<br>
        We'll hear the sound<br>
        As you're falling down<br>
        <br>
        And will you pray for me?<br>
        Or make a saint of me?<br>
        And will you lay for me?<br>
        Or make saint?<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I'll give you all the nails you need<br>
        Cover me in gasoline<br>
        Wipe away those tears of blood again<br>
        And the punchline to the joke is asking<br>
        Someone save us<br>
        <br>
        Heaven help us now<br>
        Come crashing down<br>
        We'll hear the sound<br>
        As you fall<br>
        <br>
        And would you pray for me?<br>
        (You don't know a thing about my sins)<br>
        (How the misery begins)<br>
        Or make a saint of me?<br>
        (You don't know)<br>
        (So I'm burning, I'm burning)<br>
        And will you lay for me?<br>
        (You don't know a thing about my sins)<br>
        (How the misery begins)<br>
        Or make a saint?<br>
        (You don't know)<br>
        ('Cause I'm burning, I'm burning)<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I'll give you all the nails you need<br>
        (I'm burning, I'm burning again)<br>
        Cover me in gasoline again<br>
