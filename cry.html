    <p class="lyrics">
        Gonna take off all my skin<br>
        Tear apart all of my insides<br>
        When they rifle in<br>
        Mom and Dad think you'll be saved<br>
        <br>
        They never had the time<br>
        They gonna medicate your lives<br>
        You were always born a crime<br>
        We salute you in your grave<br>
        <br>
        Can't find my way home<br>
        But it's through you and I know<br>
        What I'll do<br>
        Just to get back in her arms<br>
        <br>
        Can't find my way home<br>
        But it's through you and I know<br>
        What I'll do<br>
        Just to get back in her er er er er<br>
        <br>
        Well my gun fires seven different shades of shit<br>
        So what's your favorite color, punk?<br>
        <br>
        D'you wanna hold my hand?<br>
        Could you sign this photograph<br>
        'cause I'm your biggest fan<br>
        Would you leave me lyin' here?<br>
        <br>
        We ain't here to pay a compliment<br>
        Or sing about the government<br>
        Oxycontin genocide<br>
        Adolescent suicide<br>
        Give me my sincerity<br>
        Don't give a fuck about a Kennedy<br>
        Here's what I got to say:<br>
        <br>
        Can't find my way home<br>
        But it's through you and I know<br>
        What I'll do<br>
        Just to get back in her arms<br>
        <br>
        Can't find my way home<br>
        But it's through you and I know<br>
        What I'll do<br>
        Just to get back in her er er er er<br>
        <br>
        Whoa oh oh<br>
        Way e ay e oh<br>
        Whoa oh oh<br>
        Way e ay e oh<br>
        <br>
        OWWWW<br>
        <br>
        Can't find my way home<br>
        But it's through you and I know<br>
        What I'll do<br>
        Just to get back in her arms<br>
        <br>
        Can't find my way home<br>
        But it's through you and I know<br>
        What I'll do<br>
        Just to get back in her arms<br>
        <br>
        Can't find the way<br>
        Can't find the way<br>
        Can't find the way yay yay yay yay<br>
        Can't find the way yay yay yay yay<br>
        <br>
        C'mon, Angel, don't you cry<br>
        C'mon, Angel, don't you cry<br>
        C'mon, Angel, don't you cry<br>
        C'mon, Angel, don't you cry<br>
