            My feet are aching<br>
            And your back is pretty tired<br>
            And we've drunk a couple bottles, babe<br>
            And set our grief aside<br>
            The papers say it's doomsday<br>
            The button has been pressed<br>
            We're gonna nuke each other up boys<br>
            'Til old Satan stands impressed<br>
            <br>
            And here it is, our final night alive<br>
            As the earth burns to the ground<br>
            <br>
            Oh girl, it's you that I lie with<br>
            As the atom bomb locks in<br>
            Oh, it's you I watch TV with<br>
            As the world, as the world caves in<br>
            <br>
            You've put your final suit on<br>
            I paint my fingernails<br>
            Oh, we're going out in style, babe<br>
            And everything's on sale<br>
            We creep up on extinction<br>
            I pull your arms right in<br>
            I weep and say goodnight, love<br>
            While my organs pack it in<br>
            <br>
            And here it is, our final night alive<br>
            And as the earth burns to the ground<br>
            <br>
            Oh girl, it's you that I lie with<br>
            As the atom bomb locks in<br>
            Oh, it's you I watch TV with<br>
            As the world, as the world caves<br>
            <br>
            Oh, it's you that I lie with<br>
            As the atom bomb locks in<br>
            Oh, it's you I welcome death with<br>
            As the world, as the world caves in<br>
            <br>
            As the world caves in<br>
