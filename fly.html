        Yeah!<br>
        <br>
        Well, let's go back to the middle of the day that starts it all<br>
        I can't begin to let you know just what I'm feeling<br>
        And now, the red ones make me fly<br>
        And the blue ones help me fall<br>
        And I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling<br>
        <br>
        And as the fragments of my skull begin to fall<br>
        Fall on your tongue like pixie dust<br>
        Just think happy thoughts<br>
        And we'll fly home, we'll fly home<br>
        <br>
        You and I, we'll fly home<br>
        Come on!<br>
        <br>
        Well now, I'm back in the middle of the day that starts it all<br>
        I can't begin to let you know just what I'm feeling<br>
        And now, these red ones make me fly<br>
        And the blue ones help me fall<br>
        And I think I'll blow my brains<br>
        Against the ceiling now<br>
        <br>
        We'll fly home<br>
        You and I, we'll fly home<br>
        Now honestly, that's what I said to her<br>
        What I said to her<br>
        <br>
        Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts<br>
        Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts<br>
        Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts<br>
        Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts<br>
        Think ha... Whoo!<br>
