    <p class="lyrics">
        Always lighting up every room<br>
        Seems so perfect from every point of view<br>
        Just one look is more than enough<br>
        Makes you believe in something above
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        But not everything's always as it seems<br>
        It's a different story laying beneath
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        She's cold, she's dark, she's cynical<br>
        She's forever angry at the world<br>
        She's no angel, but she is my religion<br>
        Always finding ways to numb the pain<br>
        She's mad and she will never change<br>
        She's no angel, but she is my religion, religion
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        Everybody wants to have their taste<br>
        I'm no different, I am just the same<br>
        But she helped me find a different kinda love<br>
        Made me feel like I was finally enough
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        But there's more going on behind the scenes<br>
        She needs this love just as much as me
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        She's cold, she's dark, she's cynical<br>
        She's forever angry at the world<br>
        She's no angel, but she is my religion<br>
        Always finding ways to numb the pain<br>
        She's mad and she will never change<br>
        She's no angel, but she is my religion, religion
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        Religion, religion<br>
        Religion, religion<br>
        Religion, religion<br>
        Religion, religion
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
        She's cold, she's dark, she's cynical<br>
        She's forever angry at the world<br>
        She's no angel, but she is my religion<br>
        Always finding ways to numb the pain<br>
        She's mad and she will never change<br>
        She's no angel, but she is my religion, religion
