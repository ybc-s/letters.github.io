        Seems I get in my own way<br>
        The more I think, the less I say<br>
        I hope I communicate the craving<br>
        Now I see intentions don't mean much<br>
        <br>
        Say enough, say enough<br>
        Did I let her know, let her know<br>
        If I found my body in chains<br>
        I'd lay down in wait<br>
        And hope she looks for me<br>
        And hope she looks for me<br>
        <br>
        She just wants to catch a wave<br>
        Ride it out to the end of the days<br>
        I hope that I can satiate the craving<br>
        Now I see a gesture don't mean much<br>
        <br>
        Say enough, say enough<br>
        Did I let her know, let her know<br>
        If I found my body in chains<br>
        I'd lay down in wait<br>
        And hope she looks for me<br>
        And hope she looks for me<br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)<br>
        <br>
        Say enough, say enough<br>
        Did I let her know, let her know<br>
        If I found my body in chains<br>
        I'd lay down in wait<br>
        'Cause it's the fear of the unknown<br>
        That cripples every step we take<br>
        And I just hate to put this on her<br>
        But I swear that I will give more than I <font color="#a41c1a">take</font> away<br>
        Mm, the craving<br>
        <br>
        Now I see intentions don't mean much<br>
