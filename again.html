        We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when,<br>
        But I know we'll meet again, some sunny day.<br>
        Keep smiling through, just like you always do,<br>
        'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away.<br>
        <br>
        So will you please say hello to the folks that I knkow,<br>
        Tell them I won't be long.<br>
        They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go,<br>
        I was singing this song.<br>
        <br>
