        Turn away<br>
        If you could get me a drink<br>
        Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded<br>
        Call my aunt Marie<br>
        Help her gather all my things<br>
        And bury me in all my favorite <font color="#db442b">colors</font><br>
        My sisters and my brothers, still<br>
        I will not kiss you<br>
        'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you<br>
        <br>
        I will not kiss you (kiss you)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded<br>
        Call my (turn away)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded (faded)<br>
        Kiss you (kiss you)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded<br>
        Call my (turn away)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded (faded)<br>
        <br>
        Turn away<br>
        'Cause I'm awful just to see<br>
        And all my hairs abandoned all my body<br>
        All my agony<br>
        Know that I will never marry<br>
        Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo<br>
        I'm counting down the days to go<br>
        This just ain't livin'<br>
        And I just hope you know<br>
        <br>
        I will not kiss you (kiss you)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded<br>
        Call my (turn away)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded (faded)<br>
        Kiss you (kiss you)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded<br>
        Call my (turn away)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded (faded)<br>
        <br>
        If you say (if you say)<br>
        Goodbye today (goodbye today)<br>
        I'll ask you to be true (I'll ask you to be true)<br>
        'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you<br>
        Yes, the hardest part of this<br>
        <br>
        I will not kiss you (kiss you)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded<br>
        Call my (call my)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded (faded)<br>
        Kiss you (kiss you)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded<br>
        Call my (call my)<br>
        Lips are chapped and faded (faded)<br>
