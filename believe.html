        Just take it all<br>
        For nothing, again<br>
        Create, release<br>
        She just don't feel the same<br>
        <br>
        I asked, and you answered<br>
        But you eat your words in frame<br>
        At last discover<br>
        You can't recall my name<br>
        <br>
        Until I let you fall<br>
        I've been left no choice<br>
        Don't you see that?<br>
        <br>
        You come crawling back to me<br>
        But I'm already on the ground<br>
        And we all know that talk is cheap<br>
        So come on and save me now<br>
        And you wonder what I believe<br>
        But you don't wanna be around<br>
        So what would you do for me?<br>
        Yeah, what would you do for me?<br>
        <br>
        I won't repeat what I have said beforehand<br>
        My love withers and chokes in perfect awe<br>
        <br>
        'Til I let you fall, ah (why don't you just say what you wanted to say?)<br>
        I've been left no choice (why don't you just say what you wanted to say?)<br>
        Don't you see that? (Why don't you just say what you wanted to say?)<br>
        <br>
        You come crawling back to me<br>
        But I'm already on the ground<br>
        And we all know that talk is cheap<br>
        So come on and save me now<br>
        And you wonder what I believe<br>
        But you don't wanna be around<br>
        So what would you do for me?<br>
        Yeah, what would you do for me?<br>
        <br>
        You come crawling back to me<br>
