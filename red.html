        We sit side by side<br>
        I wanna know what you feel like<br>
        Tell me what you feel like<br>
        You haven't left my mind<br>
        Trust me that I've tried and I've tried, I've tried<br>
        <br>
        At the hotel, I met you for a drink<br>
        And after two or three you were all over me, oh, all over me<br>
        Oh, and I know red's your favourite colour<br>
        And we sat in the same place doing impressions of each other<br>
        <br>
        Oh no, baby, are we gonna make it this time?<br>
        I always take hearts that shouldn't be mine, be mine<br>
        Slow down baby, are we gonna make it alive?<br>
        You've got a face that I always recognise<br>
        Always recognise<br>
        <br>
        And you laughed at my crooked teeth<br>
        But you said that they suited me<br>
        And you pay attention to everything<br>
        And I know what your friends would say<br>
        Oh, it doesn't matter, they're all in love with me anyway<br>
        <br>
        Oh no, baby, are we gonna make it this time?<br>
        I always take hearts that shouldn't be mine, be mine<br>
        Slow down baby, are we gonna make it alive?<br>
        You've got a face that I always recognise<br>
        Always recognise<br>
        <br>
        Oh, and I know red's your favourite colour<br>
        Oh, and I know red's your favourite colour<br>
        I just wanna know<br>
        <br>
        Oh no, baby, are we gonna make it this time?<br>
        I always take hearts that shouldn't be mine, be mine<br>
        Slow down baby, are we gonna make it alive?<br>
        You've got a face that I always recognise<br>
        Always recognise<br>
        <br>
        Oh, and I know red's your favourite colour<br>
        Oh, and I know red's your favourite colour<br>
        Your favourite colour<br>
