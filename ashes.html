    <p class="lyrics">
        Well, you gonna live your life in misery<br>
        And the angels all despair<br>
        They know all the times you whittled down<br>
        The halo 'round your head<br>
        And I said hey, hey, how you doing?<br>
        The others are to blame<br>
        And the angels gather 'round you<br>
        And brought us all to say<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna see you burn in hell<br>
        And I don't wanna pay respect<br>
        <br>
        And hey, what I want to say<br>
        And suffer all the angels, this purifying flame<br>
        Darling, I'm a bad man, make me play the game<br>
        We knew from the get go, we were all to blame<br>
        <br>
        Ring around the ambulance<br>
        Like I never gave a care<br>
        'Cause ashes are to ashes<br>
        And we fall down all again<br>
        And I said, hey now hallelujah<br>
        Sing the praise again<br>
        They'll hunt us down "Well, is it hot in here?<br>
        Or is it just me all again?"<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna see you burn in hell<br>
        And I don't wanna see you burn in hell<br>
        <br>
        And hey, what I want to say<br>
        What if all the angels could get into my game<br>
        What if I'm that bad man, purifying flame<br>
        Punish all the sinners running from the end?<br>
        <br>
        You could bitch all you want<br>
        But I'm never gonna leave you alone<br>
        And you can hide up in that attic<br>
        But I'm always gonna find you at home<br>
        And as the blood runs down the walls<br>
        You see me creepin' up these halls<br>
        And I'm a bad motherfucker<br>
        An abandoned mental lover<br>
        Go<br>
        <br>
        I said hey, what I want to say<br>
        Suffer all the angels, take my life again<br>
        Maybe if the bad man killed me once again<br>
        Punish all my sins and take my life again<br>
        <br>
        What I wanna say, what I wanna say<br>
        What I wanna say, what I wanna say<br>
        What I wanna say, what I wanna say<br>
        What I wanna say, is you're sorry, oh yeah, completely, sorry<br>
