            Drowning in the Blue Nile<br>
            He sent me 'Downtown Lights'<br>
            I hadn't heard it in a while<br>
            My boredom's bone deep<br>
            This cage was once just fine<br>
            Am I allowed to cry?<br>
            I dream of cracking locks<br>
            Throwing my life to the wolves<br>
            Or the ocean rocks<br>
            Crashing into him tonight<br>
            He's a paradox<br>
            I'm seeing visions, am I bad?<br>
            Or mad? Or wise?<br>
            <br>
            What if he's written 'mine' on my upper thigh<br>
            Only in my mind?<br>
            One slip and falling back into the hedge maze<br>
            Oh what a way to die<br>
            I keep recalling things we never did<br>
            Messy top lip kiss<br>
            How I long for our trysts<br>
            Without ever touching his skin<br>
            How can I be guilty as sin?
            <br>
            I keep these longings locked<br>
            In lowercase inside a vault<br>
            Someone told me<br>
            There's no such thing as bad thoughts<br>
            Only your actions talk<br>
            These fatal fantasies<br>
            Giving way to labored breath<br>
            Taking all of me<br>
            We've already done it in my head<br>
            If it's make believe<br>
            Why does it feel like a vow<br>
            We'll both uphold somehow?<br>
            <br>
            What if he's written 'mine' on my upper thigh<br>
            Only in my mind?<br>
            One slip and falling back into the hedge maze<br>
            Oh what a way to die<br>
            My bedsheets are ablaze<br>
            I've screamed his name<br>
            Building up like waves<br>
            Crashing over my grave<br>
            Without ever touching his skin<br>
            How can I be guilty as sin?
            <br>
            What if I roll the stone away?<br>
            They're gonna crucify me anyway<br>
            What if the way you hold me<br>
            Is actually what's holy?<br>
            If long suffering propriety<br>
            Is what they want from me<br>
            They don't know how you've haunted me<br>
            So stunningly<br>
            I choose you and me<br>
            ... Religiously<br>
            <br>
            What if he's written 'mine' on my upper thigh<br>
            Only in my mind?<br>
            One slip and falling back into the hedge maze<br>
            Oh what a way to die<br>
            I keep recalling things we never did<br>
            Messy top lip kiss<br>
            How I long for our trysts<br>
            Without ever touching his skin<br>
            How can I be guilty as sin?<br>
            <br>
            He sent me 'Downtown Lights'<br>
            I hadn't heard it in a while<br>
            Am I allowed to cry?<br>
