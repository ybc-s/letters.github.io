    <p class="lyrics">
        I like everything that's blue<br>
        Like the color of my room<br>
        But almost every day<br>
        The skies are colored grey<br>
        I do the best that I can do<br>
        <br>
        I like everything that's blue<br>
        Like when her eyes shine like the moon<br>
        Like a slap against my face<br>
        I love the after-taste<br>
        I've got nothing left to lose<br>
        <br>
        The ocean says that I can go wherever, but it lies<br>
        I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather<br>
        We're up all night 'cause we don't like the treasure that we find<br>
        I'll right the wrongs I wrote to get us back together<br>
        <br>
        I-I-I-I<br>
        I-I<br>
        I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather<br>
        I-I-I-I<br>
        I-I<br>
        I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather<br>
        <br>
        I like everything that's blue<br>
        Like the TV when it's mute<br>
        I'm trying not to rest<br>
        But I'm lying on my bed with my self-inflicted bruise<br>
        I like every-, wait<br>
        <br>
        I'll keep you from my heart, far away from harm<br>
        Got teeth along my arms when I hold you<br>
        I'll keep you in the dark where I don't know where you are<br>
        It's so hard, but I have to<br>
        So run away from me, I'm not what you see<br>
        Tearing down the lights in my bedroom<br>
        It's better if I'm blind, and I don't know where to find you<br>
        <br>
        The ocean says that I can go wherever, but it lies<br>
        I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather<br>
        We're up all night 'cause we don't like the treasure that we find<br>
        I'll right the wrongs I wrote to get us back together<br>
        <br>
        I-I-I-I<br>
        I-I<br>
        I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather<br>
        I-I-I-I<br>
        I-I<br>
        I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather<br>
        <br>
        Blue<br>
        If only I had thought it through<br>
        I'm running out of breath<br>
        And it seems as if you're deaf<br>
        I liked everything with you<br>
